# Hi, I'm Sreemukh 👋

**Backend & Platform Engineer | Systems Enthusiast**

I specialize in building scalable internal platforms, workflow orchestration, and high-performance data pipelines. My background spans from low-level C instrumentation to modern LLM serving infrastructure. Recently, I've been focusing on Go for high-concurrency systems and Python for robust backend services.
